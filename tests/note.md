**What is Photosynthesis?**

- "Photo" means light (Greek word)
- "Synthesis" means putting together (Greek word)
- **Photosynthesis** = using light to put things together

**How Plants Make Food**

- Use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to make food
- Roots absorb nutrients and water from the ground
- Leaves contain tiny openings called **stomata** that take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen
- **Chloroplasts** (tiny pigments) turn carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight into sugar and oxygen

**Key Points**

- Plants "breathe" in carbon dioxide and produce oxygen through stomata
- Oxygen is released into the atmosphere
- Sugar produced is used as food by plants
- **Chlorophyll** (green pigment) helps plants look green

**Fun Facts**

- Plants are often called the "lungs of the world" because they take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen for humans to breathe.
- Plants use photosynthesis to make their own food!
